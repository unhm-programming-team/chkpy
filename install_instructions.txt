WSL notes:
	things are a little differnt on wsl and therefore certan dependances may be missing initaly
	the one that is ususaly missing is "pip" if you get "cannot find command "pip" x similar",
	run "python --version" and install pip according to your version. 

	any pip version under pip3 will not work on wsl becasue the EXACT pacage name needs to be called 
	to run that package.
